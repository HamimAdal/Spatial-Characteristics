# Spatial Characteristics

The Design of a user-space interacting framework that works as a mediator between the user and smart space, shifting the level of abstraction from device level (e.g., smart light, smart speaker, smart HVAC, etc.) to a set of properties called spatial characteristics (i.e., illumination, sound, temperature, etc.) that influence the physical environment. The goal is to realize user interactions in terms of spatial characteristics where the user interacts with properties of the space (e.g., ``Alexa, provide me illumination for reading a book on my bedroom desk") instead of controlling individual devices (e.g., ``Alexa, set the brightness of the bedroom lamp to level 5"), making the user request more natural and personalized.
